## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

<!-- @pg-date 2015-06-29 -->
## Day 1

You can tag section in the `*.md` files  with `<!-- @pg-date <ISO_DATE> -->`, like: `<!-- @pg-date 2015-06-29 -->` to attach them to a date. 
Then, if you group by date, they will show up at the assigned day.

That part of the markdown will be removed from the main markdown at the top and shown only at that day.
